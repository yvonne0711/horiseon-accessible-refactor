## Overview

### The challenge
This project is to refactor Horiseon's site to make it more accessible for users. Horiseon is a marketing agency where their website didn't meet the accessibility standards, which is important for people with disabilities and can also help with SEO purposes. Horiseon's website is now accessible-friendly with many elements altered within the code.

### Mock-up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a background image, and then a content section with text and images below as well as a benefit section at the side of that.](assets\horiseon-refactoring-img.png)

### Website
Deployed application: https://yvonne0711.github.io/horiseon-accessible-refactor/

## My process

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learnt
- Used more [semantic HTML elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) throughout the code so the code follows a more logical and meaningful structure
- Altered a lot of [image tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure) so they contained accessible `alt` attributes in HTML and learnt the `object-fit` property in CSS using this [helpful resource](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_object-fit.asp)
- Made sure all application's links function correctly using the `id` attribute
- More comfortable with HTML and CSS by improving the code - this project was good practice
